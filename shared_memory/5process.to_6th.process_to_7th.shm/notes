///SCHOOL OF LINUX///


Concept ::

	We need to create 5 process p1, p2, p3, p4 and p5, send data through msg queue from p1, p2, p3, p4, p5, to process P6.
	Then collect all the messages in P6, send it to P7 using shared memory and save the content into a file in P7.


notes  ::
	
	While compiling a posix message related system calls (like as mq_open,mq_send..), use the following command
	gcc file name	-lrt	//-lrt	"it include a rt library"...
